# MakeMyTrip

The Flight Trip automation code for MakeMyTrip, which offers One Way, Round Trip, and Multi Trip options, is built using Java Selenium.

The code is a Maven project that uses the POM model and incorporates Extent reports to generate test results with screenshots.

The test data, including user inputs such as destinations, dates, and passenger counts, is retrieved from Excel in the resources folder and then fed to the test through the Data Provider function available in TestNG.

The code includes various customizations, such as extensions for handling dynamic website advertisements, generating reports with screenshots, and cropping screenshots of specific elements.

Additionally, screen recordings of the test run will be added as the code is updated.
